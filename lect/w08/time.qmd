## Goals {background-color="#FAF1A4"}

- methods of temporal analysis
  - calibration of radiocarbon data
  - working with temporal uncertainties - introduction to the aoristic method
- R
  - joining 2 tables
  - creating a new variable based on condition in different variable
  - some tips and tricks for your ggplot

## Radiocarbon dating {background-color="#B5E2FF"}

## Evocation
- What's the difference between _absolute_ dating and _relative_ dating?
- How the archaeologists estimated absolute dates before invention of the radiocarbon dating?
- Can you tell other methods of absolute dating?

## How RC dating works

### A very simple introduction

- It is based on measurement of proportion of radioactive 14C in organic material.
- Plants are absorbing 14C from atmosphere which then continues to animals and humans through food chain.
- After the dead of the organism the 14C starts to decay, and by measuring proportion of the 14C still in the body and comparing it with the amount of 14C in atmosphere, we can measure __time when the organism died__.
- Since the amount of the 14C in atmosphere varies during time, we need to calibrate the results with so called "calibration curve".
- Keep in mind that we are not dating a date of creation of the archaeological context, but date of the death of the organism, be it human individual, grain, or a tree.

## Today's dataset

### LASOLES

Let's try to calibrate some radiocarbon data! 

We will do so with the same data as last time, from the LASOLES radiocarbon database of the Czech Republic.

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

df_lasoles <- read.csv("./data/LASOLES_14C_database.csv", sep = ";")

df_lasoles$Age14C <- as.numeric(df_lasoles$Age14C)
df_lasoles$SD14C <- as.numeric(df_lasoles$SD14C)

head(df_lasoles[, 1:7], 12)
```

```{r}
#| include: false
sum_lasoles <- df_lasoles %>%
  group_by(Civil_parish, Contex_dating_AMCR) %>% 
  summarise(pocet = n())
```
```{r}
#| include: false
df_sample <- df_lasoles %>% 
  filter(Lab_code == "Erl-4719")

```

```{r}
#| include: false
uncal_date <- df_sample$Age14C
sd_date <- df_sample$SD14C
```



## Quick calibration

- We will use a real radiocarbon date sampled from a Final Eneolihic -- Early Bronze Age site Pavlov u Dolních Věstonic, "Horní pole". 
- We will use package `rcarbon` and calibration curve [IntCal20](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/radiocarbon/article/intcal20-northern-hemisphere-radiocarbon-age-calibration-curve-055-cal-kbp/83257B63DC3AF9CFA6243F59D7503EFF) 

### Details

- uncalibrated date:  **`r uncal_date`**
- standart deviation: **`r sd_date`**

#### Additional information

- laboratory code: 	Erl-4719
- typochronological datation: Bell Beaker Culture
- archaeological context: grave
- sample: human bone
 
 
## Quick calibration 

```{r}
#| results: 'hide'
# install.packages("rcarbon")
library(rcarbon)
cal_date <- calibrate(x = 3990, errors = 54, calCurves = "intcal20")
```
```{r}
summary(cal_date)
```

```{r}
#| include: false
sum_cal_date <- summary(cal_date)
cal_median_bp <- sum_cal_date$MedianBP
cal_median_bce <- cal_median_bp - 1950
```

Median of the calibrated date is __`r cal_median_bp` BP__


## Quick plot

```{r}
plot(cal_date)
```

## Improving your plot

```{r}
plot(cal_date, calendar = "BCAD", HPD = TRUE)
```

- argument `HPD` higlights confidence of the posterior density, by default set to 95% (2 standard deviations)


## Why I can't get single BCE number?

```{r}
#| echo: FALSE
plot(cal_date, calendar = "BCAD", HPD = TRUE)
abline(h=uncal_date, col = "red")
abline(h=uncal_date, col = adjustcolor("grey", alpha = 0.25), lwd = sd_date+5) # pridal som 5 k šírke aby som zvýraznil pretínanie sd s kalibračnou krivkou
```


## Plotting multiple samples {.scrollable}
- let's create a subset with samples from our site, dated to the Final Eneolithic and Early Bronze Age and having no dating errors
- copy and paste this code from our web:

```{r}
#| results: 'hide'
df_sample_site <- df_lasoles %>% 
  filter(Civil_parish == "Pavlov u Dolních Věstonic" & 
         Site_name == "Horní pole" & 
         Age14C > 3500 & 
         Age14C < 5000 & 
         Dating_error == "n")
```


```{r}
#| results: 'hide'
cal_dates <- calibrate(x = df_sample_site$Age14C, errors = df_sample_site$SD14C, calCurves = "intcal20", ids = df_sample_site$Lab_code) 
```

```{r}
head(summary(cal_dates),4)
```

## Multiplot

```{r}
multiplot(cal_dates, decreasing=TRUE, HPD=TRUE, label.pos=0.9, label.offset=-200,  calendar = "BCAD")
```

## Radiocarbon dates as proxies for human demography

- in recent years, radiocarbon data are being widely used  for determining relative demography
- different methods, e.g. summed probability distribution (SPD) or kernel density estimation (KDE)

Long-term demographic trends and spatio-temporal distribution of past human activity in Central Europe: Comparison of archaeological and palaeoecological proxies.

## Exercise {background-color="#B5E2FF"}

1. Clean your workspace, create a new script in your project folder, load the database [LASOLES](./data/LASOLES_14C_database.csv).
2. Create a new dataframe with data from burial site *Vedrovice - Široká u lesa*, dated to *Linear Pottery Culture*.
3. Calibrate all the data and create a multiplot.

**Hints**: ne.lin, filter(), multiplot()

## Working with temporal uncertainties {background-color="#B5E2FF"}

## Problem

```{r}
#| include: FALSE
df_datations <- read.csv("./data/datation_mor.csv", sep = ",")
```

- Imagine you are trying to model intensity of human occupation in longer time period  by quantifing archaeological contexts but you are struggling with the problem how to compare contexts with various accuracy of their dating. 
- E.g. some contexts are dated vaguely to "neolithic period" because the only artefact found there was a culturaly insignificant polished axe. And on the contrary, other contexts are dated to shorter periods such as "Stroked Pottery Culture period" (_vypíchaná ker._) thanks to finds of recognizable ornamented pottery. 


## 

![](./figs/meme.png){fig-width=80%}

## 

```{r}
#| echo: false
df_datation_neol <- df_datations %>% 
  filter(date_start>=-5400 & date_end<=-4300)

marks2 <- seq(-5500, -4000, by = 100)

ggplot(data=df_datation_neol)+
  geom_segment(aes(x=date_start, xend=date_end, y=(reorder(kultura, date_start)), yend=kultura), color = "grey50")+
  geom_point(aes(x=date_start, y=kultura),color="steelblue", size=4)+
  geom_point(aes(x=date_end, y=kultura),color="steelblue", size=4)+
  labs(y="typochronological dating", x="BCE")+
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = marks2)+ 
  theme_light()
```

## Aoristic method

- will help us with overcoming difficulties with temporal uncertainties
- see [Crema, E.R. 2012](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10816-011-9122-3) for more details

- what we need:
  - for every archaeological context we need a typo-chronological datation and start date and end date of each of these datations, such as in example below:
 
```{r}
#| echo: FALSE
context_number <- c("pit1", "pit2", "pit3", "grave1")
context_dating_AMCR <- c("ne.lin", "neolit", "ne.lin", "ne.lin")
date_start <- c(-5400, -5400, -5300, -5300)
date_end <- c(-4801, -4301, -4801, -4801)

table_datations <- data.frame(context_number, context_dating_AMCR, date_start, date_end)
```

```{r}
#| echo: FALSE
table_datations
```
## Joining two tables together
 - for the sake of the simplicity and for these educational purposes, we will work with LASOLES database as if it does not consists of radiocarbon samples but of contexts of these samples dated typo-chronologicaly to various periods
- but since LASOLES does not have variables with information about start and end date, we will need to get those information from another datase - [datation_mor.csv](./data/datation_mor.csv)


```{r}
#| eval: FALSE
df_datations <- read.csv(here("datation_mor.csv"))
```
```{r}
head(df_datations,4)
```

- now we need to add variables date_start and date_end to dataframe df_lasoles. We will do so by joining the two tables through variables "kultura" and "Contex_dating_AMCR" by command `right_join`

```{r}
df_lasoles <- df_lasoles %>% 
  right_join(df_datations, by = c("Contex_dating_AMCR" = "kultura"))
```
```{r}
df_lasoles$date_start <- as.numeric(df_lasoles$date_start)
df_lasoles$date_end <- as.numeric(df_lasoles$date_end)
```
- see [documentation](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/mutate-joins.html) for different types of joins

## Saving your new dataframe

You can save your new dataframe now so you don't need to join the tables again next time:

```{r}
#| eval: false
write.csv(df_lasoles, file = here("df_lasoles2.csv"), row.names = FALSE)
```

## Calculation of the aoristic sum

Package - `aoristAAR`

```{r}
#| eval: false
if(!require('devtools')) install.packages('devtools')

library(devtools)
install_github('ISAAKiel/aoristAAR')

library(aoristAAR)
```

Calculation:
```{r}
library(aoristAAR)

aori <- aorist(df_lasoles, from = "date_start", to = "date_end", method = "period_correction", stepwidth = 1)

head(aori, 4)
```

## Plot
Quick plot:
```{r}
ggplot()+
  geom_line(data = aori, aes(x=date, y=sum))
```

## Improving your plot

- command `geom_vline` adds vertical line on coordinates defined by you
- in this case, we mark -5400 BCE

```{r}
ggplot()+
  geom_line(data = aori, aes(x=date, y=sum))+
  geom_vline(xintercept = -5400, color = "red")
```

## But why stop here?
- lets mark the periods in your plot and divide the x-axis by 1000 years!

```{r}
periods <- c(-9600, -5400, -4300, -2200, -800, -480, -30, 581)
marks <- seq(-10000, 1500, by = 1000)

ggplot()+
  geom_vline(xintercept = periods, color = "red", linetype = 2)+
  geom_line(data = aori, aes(x=date, y=sum))+
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = marks)+ 
  labs(x="BCE/AD", y="aoristic sum")+
  theme_light()
```

- notice that when we've changed the order of the lines so the later overlaps the earlier
- for the sake of simplicity, we will ignore the year "0" which should not exist

## Grouping areals into broader categories {.scrollable}
What if we want to observe differences in aoristic sum for different site category? For example settlements versus burial sites? 

- first, we can check how many different site categories are being used

```{r}
unique(df_lasoles$Site_category_ENG)
```

There are too many areals for any usefull visualisation, so we need to group them to broader categories. For example burial grounds and tumuli will be in one category only.

- first step is creating vectors of site categories:
```{r}
l_settlements <- c("settlement", "hillfort", "settlement-exp", "military camp", "large circular enclosure", "enclosure")
l_burials <- c("burial ground", "tumuli")
l_hoards <- c("hoard of a bronze artefacts", "hoard other", "hoard of ceramic vessels")
l_other <- c("single find", "cave or abri", "secondary find", "extraction site", "unpublished","ritual_site" )
```


- then with the help of `mutate` will create a new variable "new_category"
```{r}
df_lasoles <- df_lasoles %>% 
  mutate(new_category = ifelse(Site_category_ENG %in% l_settlements, "settlements",
                ifelse(Site_category_ENG %in% l_burials, "burials",
                       ifelse(Site_category_ENG %in% l_hoards, "hoards",
                              ifelse(Site_category_ENG %in% l_other, "other",
                                     "no-data")))))
```

## Aoristic for different categories

Now we can create aoristic sum for each new site category. Let's try it for settlements and burials:

```{r}
df_settlements <- df_lasoles %>% 
  filter(new_category == "settlements")
df_burials <- df_lasoles %>% 
  filter(new_category == "burials")
```

```{r}
aori_settlements <- aorist(df_settlements, from = "date_start", to = "date_end", method = "period_correction", stepwidth = 1)
aori_burials <- aorist(df_burials, from = "date_start", to = "date_end", method = "period_correction", stepwidth = 1)
```

```{r}
ggplot()+
  geom_line(data = aori_settlements, aes(x=date, y=sum), color = "red")+
  geom_line(data = aori_burials, aes(x=date, y=sum), color = "blue")+
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = marks)+ 
  theme_light()
```

## Easy subseting
- you can create similar subsets without creating a new variable:

```{r}
l_enclosures <- c("large circular enclosure", "enclosure")

df_enclosures <- df_lasoles %>% 
  filter(Site_category_ENG %in% l_enclosures)

aori_encl <- aorist(df_enclosures, from = "date_start", to = "date_end", method = "period_correction", stepwidth = 1)

ggplot()+
  geom_line(data = aori_encl, aes(x=date, y=sum))
```



## Exercise
1. clean your workspace, create new script, load either the new lasoles table (with end and start dates) or the old one, but then join it with datation table
2. create a dataframe of fortificated areas, consisting of hillforts, elevated settlements (settlement-exp) and military camps
3. calculate an aoristic sum for these fortificated areas and show it in ggplot
4. add marks to your ggplot visualizing the start and the end of the Iron age period (-800 and -21 BCE)
5. create a map of those fortified areas in the Czech republic (you will need to create a `sf` file and load "republika" from `RCzechia`)
6. create the same map, but only in Olomoucký kraj
