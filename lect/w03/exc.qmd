This is an exercise where you will **load the data** to R, do some **cleaning**, **transformations** and **plotting**!

The exercise **simulates** *real-world archaeological research* where you need to **explore** burial patterns, artefact distributions, and relationships between different aspects of the site...

The data set is an *export* from a **fabricated database** of an excavation of a Bronze Age cemetery.


> *Caution! The data set is purely synthetic and fabricated for didactic purposes.*

## Dataset Overview

The dataset consists of 3 related CSV files:

- [{{< bi file-earmark-arrow-down >}} `graves.csv`](lect/w03/data/graves.csv) -- grave information and grave features, human remains information;
- [{{< bi file-earmark-arrow-down >}} `artefacts.csv`](lect/w03/data/artefacts.csv) -- artefact records with materials, weights, preservation etc.


## Brainstorming

Let's formulate **research questions** to guide the analysis...

## Tips for Success

- **Start simple**: Begin with basic exploration before complex analysis.
- **Handle missing data**: Archaeological datasets always have missing values -- plan for them.
- **Document your findings**: Add comments explaining what each analysis reveals.
- **Visualize early**: Charts help identify patterns and outliers.


## Download and explore the data...

- Save the data as CSVs to your project folder.

`.../data/burials.csv`  
`.../data/artefacts.csv`

- Explore the CSVs.
- Are there missing values?
- How are missing values encoded?
- Why are there missing values?


## Load and explore the data

- Load the data set to R.
- Explore the structure of the data set.
- How many graves and artefacts are there?
- How many columns does each table have?
- What is the structure?

## Clean the data

- Identify errors in encoding of the information etc.
- Check lecture on [Tidy data](/lect/w01/tidy.qmd) if needed.
- What datatypes are there in each table?
- What are the primary keys?
- How do the tables relate one to the other?

## Basic stats

- Calculate descriptive statistics for numerical variables.

### Questions to investigate

- What is the average height of people buried in the cemetery?
- What age categories are most common?
- What is the mean and range of grave depths and mound diameters?
- What is the average weight of bronze artefacts?
- How many artefact types are represented?
- What are the artefacts made of?


## Data Visualizations

Create visual representations of your archaeological data.

### Visualization tasks

- Bar chart of artefact types.
- Histogram of artefact weights by material.
- Boxplot of estimated heights by sex.
- Scatterplot of grave depth vs mound diameter.


## Data Manipulation

Transform and combine your tables to answer further research questions.

### Data manipulation tasks

- Filter for well-preserved bronze weapons.
- Create age groups from age categories.
- Calculate artefact amount per grave.

*Hint: Use `left_join()` to combine tables.*  
*Hint: Use `case_when()` for complex conditional logic when creating new variables.*

## Grouped Analysis

Perform analyses grouped by categorical variables.

### Grouped analysis tasks

- Average artefact weight by type and material.
- Number of artefacts per burial type.
- How does height differ across sexes and age groups?
- Preservation state distribution by artefact type.
