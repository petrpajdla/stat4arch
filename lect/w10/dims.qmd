## Multivariate data 

### Univariate

- One variable 

### Bivariate 

- Two variables

### Multivariate 

- Many variables 
- Also multidimensinal 

## Dimensionality reduction 

### The *curse* of higher dimensions 

- Computational ineffectivity.
- Low data density in higher dimensions.
- Problematic visualization, human brain does not easily cope with more than 3D.
- Difficult interpretation.

## Principal components analysis 

**Goal**: Find low-dimensional representation of the observations that explain a good fraction of the variation.

- First principal component is a direction that maximizes the variance of the projected data.
- Second PC is orthogonal to the previous one.

## Biplot
