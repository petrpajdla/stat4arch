Information given here will be updated later in the semestr.

:::

To pass the course you will have to work on a small project.
Group/pair cooperation is possible, but each student has to submit their own report on the analysis.
There are two options, you can choose to work either on your own dataset or use
an existing published data.

## Get the data

Although the first step in most of the analysis would be creating the research
question(s), we assume our questions and goals are already set and skip to the step
where we get the data suitable to answer our questions...

### Working with your own dataset
- You can choose to use your own data. This is especially useful if you are
  working on your BA/MA/PhD thesis or an article and want to analyze the
  data collected for the given work.
- This option is easier because you probably know what your dataset contains and
  what each variable means, how it was collected etc.

### Using an existing dataset
- Find a suitable dataset online, scrape a website, get it in a book,
  anything that comes to mind, be creative.
  Bear in mind that the dataset needs to contain a mixture of
  quantitative and qualitative variables. It can be organized as a table, then
  the work is easier for you. If it is a database, we can give you a hand with
  data preparation etc.
- We recommend to look in the
  [Journal of Open Archaeology Data](https://openarchaeologydata.metajnl.com/).
  Datasets published here have clear use conditions (license), are deposited
  in a suitable repository and should be well documented.
- If you choose to use a dataset you found anywhere else (or web scraped etc.)
  please make sure that it is easily accessible and suitable for the analysis.

## Get to know the data
- Make sure you know where your data is and how is it stored (format and how to read it into R).
- Make sure you know what each variable means, what type of data does it contain etc.
- The dataset should contain at least several quantitative and qualitative variables in order for you to be able to practice creating visualizations.

### Report template

RMarkdown template for the project report is [here](https://github.com/petrpajdla/stat4arch/blob/7e6d4d67b6e13a5208512951f92751287f22495e/project/project_template.Rmd).
Create a new RMarkdown file (`.Rmd`), copy and paste the contents of the template
in your file, do your changes, write your report and push the `Knit` button.
Follow the instructions in the template to work on your project.

### How to submit the report

Feel free to contact us if you need any help or assistance during the work on
your project. Simply send us both the source `Rmd` file and the `HTML` output
with your questions and we will address the problem either directly or in class.
