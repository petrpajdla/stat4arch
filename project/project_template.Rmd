```

This is a template for a report on your project. 
As you already know, we expect you to work on an analysis of 
a data set of your choice and hand in a report similar to 
this one. Delete the following examples as soon as you will 
be sure what you are doing. 
The suggested structure of a report is below.
Delete anything you do not need, feel free to edit the document.

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

### Abstract

Write a short and comprehensive abstract for your project 
(one paragraph of text). 

#### Keywords

Include several relevant keywords.

## Introduction

Write what data set you are analyzing and why, what is your goal and so on (one paragraph).

Also load all the packages you will be using in 
your analysis here.

```{r packages}
# put your library calls in here
library(ggplot2)
```

### Data

Briefly introduce your data set. Where does it come from?
What does it contain? 
Load your data here and use any handy functions you learned to
show what the variable names are, how big your data are,
what data types does it contain etc.

```{r data}
# read your data set here
# remember, this # is a comment (ctrl+shift+c)
# data <- read.csv("")
```

Try to answer following questions using code:

- How many variables are there?
- How many rows does the data set have?
- What are the names of the variables?
- What data types are there in the data set?

```{r structure}
# str(data) and other functions you learned...
```

## Exploratory analysis

### Qualitative variables

Are there any qualitative variables in your data set?
Choose at least one and answer these questions if possible:

- How many values does your qualitative variable has?
- Show the count of values of the chosen qualitative variable in a suitable plot.

```{r bar-plot}
#  show us some plots...
# ggplot(data, aes(...)) +
#   geom_bar()
```

### Quantitative variables

Explore your quantitative variables.
Plot the distribution of the variables.
Show us a histogram or a density plot. 
Try to compare the quantities in several groups using a box plot...

Give us numeric summaries of the chosen quantitative variable:

- What is the mean and standard deviation?
- What is the median and IQR?

How does the distribution of the quantitative variable look?
Is it a normal distribution? Is it right/left-skewed? Is it multimodal?
Try to prove these points with both the graphs and a hypothesis test.

### Data transformation challenge

Use at least **three** functions 
(`filter`, `select`, `group_by`, `summarise`, `arrange`, `mutate`) 
from the `dplyr` package to 
transform your data and again show some summary statistics, plots and so on.
Be creative!
