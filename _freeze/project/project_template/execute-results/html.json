Delete the following examples as soon as you will \nbe sure what you are doing. \nThe suggested structure of a report is below.\nDelete anything you do not need, feel free to edit the document.\n\n## R Markdown\n\nThis is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.\n\nWhen you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsummary(cars)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n     speed           dist       \n Min.   : 4.0   Min.   :  2.00  \n 1st Qu.:12.0   1st Qu.: 26.00  \n Median :15.0   Median : 36.00  \n Mean   :15.4   Mean   : 42.98  \n 3rd Qu.:19.0   3rd Qu.: 56.00  \n Max.   :25.0   Max.   :120.00  \n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Including Plots\n\nYou can also embed plots, for example:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](project_template_files/figure-html/pressure-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nNote that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.\n\n### Abstract\n\nWrite a short and comprehensive abstract for your project \n(one paragraph of text). \n\n#### Keywords\n\nInclude several relevant keywords.\n\n## Introduction\n\nWrite what data set you are analyzing and why, what is your goal and so on (one paragraph).\n\nAlso load all the packages you will be using in \nyour analysis here.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# put your library calls in here\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n```\n:::\n\n\n### Data\n\nBriefly introduce your data set. Where does it come from?\nWhat does it contain? \nLoad your data here and use any handy functions you learned to\nshow what the variable names are, how big your data are,\nwhat data types does it contain etc.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# read your data set here\n# remember, this # is a comment (ctrl+shift+c)\n# data <- read.csv(\"\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nTry to answer following questions using code:\n\n- How many variables are there?\n- How many rows does the data set have?\n- What are the names of the variables?\n- What data types are there in the data set?\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# str(data) and other functions you learned...\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Exploratory analysis\n\n### Qualitative variables\n\nAre there any qualitative variables in your data set?\nChoose at least one and answer these questions if possible:\n\n- How many values does your qualitative variable has?\n- Show the count of values of the chosen qualitative variable in a suitable plot.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#  show us some plots...\n# ggplot(data, aes(...)) +\n#   geom_bar()\n```\n:::\n\n\n### Quantitative variables\n\nExplore your quantitative variables.\nPlot the distribution of the variables.\nShow us a histogram or a density plot. \nTry to compare the quantities in several groups using a box plot...\n\nGive us numeric summaries of the chosen quantitative variable:\n\n- What is the mean and standard deviation?\n- What is the median and IQR?\n\nHow does the distribution of the quantitative variable look?\nIs it a normal distribution? Is it right/left-skewed? Is it multimodal?\nTry to prove these points with both the graphs and a hypothesis test.\n\n### Data transformation challenge\n\nUse at least **three** functions \n(`filter`, `select`, `group_by`, `summarise`, `arrange`, `mutate`) \nfrom the `dplyr` package to \ntransform your data and again show some summary statistics, plots and so on.\nBe creative!\n\n## Multivariate exploration\n\n> Will be added...\n\n\n\n\n\n",
