What does it contain? \nWhat are the variables and observations? \nHow did you get the dataset? \nWhere is it originally published (include citations, links etc.) \n\nRead your data in the next code block:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# example:\n# my_dataset <- read.csv(here(\"path/to/your/dataset.csv\"))\n```\n:::\n\n\nExplore the data set and try to answer following questions using code:\n\n- How many variables are there?\n- How many rows does the data set have?\n- What are the names of the variables?\n- What data types are there in the data set?\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# ncol(my_dataset)\n# nrow(my_dataset)\n# and so on, you know the basic functions...\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n## Analysis\n\nFocus on the analysis of your data set. \nAre there any quantitative and qualitative variables? \nShow answers to questions like these on graphs and using various numerical summaries or tests:\n\n- How are the variables distributed?\n- What are their central points and how are they spread? What does it mean?\n- Is any of the quantitative variables distributed normally?\n- What are the relationships between the variables?\n- If your points, sites etc. have coordinates, show them on a simple map.\n\nYou know how to create code blocks now, so go for it!\n**Warning** if you copy the code blocks, always change their labels, or omit them completely, because code block labels must be unique throughout the document!\nFor more help and options, have a look here: <https://quarto.org>.\n\n\n## Summary\n\nBriefly sum up and interpret what you managed to achieve in your project. \nDid you learn anything new? Did anything surprise you?\n\n",
