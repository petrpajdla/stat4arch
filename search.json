If it is a database, we can give you a hand with data preparation etc.\nWe recommend to look in the Journal of Open Archaeology Data.

Where is it originally published (include citations, links etc.) Try to answer following questions using code:\n\nHow many variables are there?\nHow many rows does the dataset have?\nWhat are the names of the variables?\nWhat data types are there in the data set?\n\nAnalysis: Focus on the analysis of your data set. Are there any quantitative and qualitative variables? Show answers to questions like these on graphs and using various numerical summaries or tests:\n\nHow are the variables distributed?\nWhat are their central points and how are they spread? What does it mean?\nIs any of the quantitative variables distributed normally?\nWhat are the relationships between the variables?\nIf your points, sites etc. have coordinates, show them on a simple map.\n\nSummary: Briefly sum up and interpret what you managed to achieve in your project.
